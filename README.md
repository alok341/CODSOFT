🚀 CodSoft Java Programming Internship

This repository contains all three Java projects completed as part of my CodSoft Internship, demonstrating core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, user input handling, conditional logic, and real-world simulations.

📘 Task 1: Number Guessing Game

A simple interactive game where the system randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts.

Features:

Random number generation

Input validation and attempt tracking

Displays total rounds, wins, and win rate

Option to replay

Concepts Used: Loops, Conditionals, Random class, User input, Basic statistics

🧮 Task 2: Grade Calculator

Takes marks for multiple subjects, calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on performance.

Features:

Dynamic subject input

Input validation (0–100)

Displays total marks, average percentage, and grade

Concepts Used: Loops, Conditional statements, Type casting, String formatting

🏧 Task 3: ATM Interface

Simulates a real ATM system with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry options using OOP concepts.

Features:

Separate BankAccount and ATM classes

Deposit, Withdraw, and Check Balance functionalities

Input validation for invalid or insufficient transactions

Interactive menu-driven interface

Concepts Used: Classes & Objects, Encapsulation, Loops, Scanner input handling

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 17 or later)

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse

Console-based programs
